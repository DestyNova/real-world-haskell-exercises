# Ideas for open-source Haskell contributions

I'll keep a list of possible open-source contributions the group could make here. Or I'll completely forget about it and this will be the last update ever to this file. Prove me wrong, future me, *prove me wrong*.

## Tooling

* AST-based refactoring / smart editing, like the amazing [Lamdu](https://github.com/lamdu/lamdu) but maybe a bit less radical and more vimmable.
  * Yeah but...
    * What would be practical, without reinventing something else?
    * Who wants it?

## Media / games

* Some sort of game?
  * Yeah but...
    * Games are kind of hard.
    * What kind of game?
    * Are there any nice frameworks for making games easily in Haskell that haven't been abandoned for years?
      * (Why does that happen...)

## Education

* Some way to help people use Haskell productively almost immediately, without needing a PhD in Haskellology or having to read 1,000 pages of dense material.
  * Yeah but...
    * How? Some kind of interactive guide to the absolute basics required to get going? What are those?
    * Is the current situation the optimal minimal time/brain investment already?
